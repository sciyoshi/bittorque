== Introduction ==

BitTorque is a BitTorrent client written in C for Linux. It
does not depend on any GNOME libraries, although can optionally
be compiled with GConf support. It aims to be fast and lightweight,
while supporting many of the new protocol extensions.


== Installation ==

To build BitTorque from source, you will need basic development tools
installed, as well as SCons, a Python-based build system. If running
on a Debian-based system, running

apt-get install scons

should do the trick. Then type

scons

from the command line to build everything.
